Daedalus Localization Information
*********************************

Last updated 27 April 2001.

This document explains how to create a Localization DLL for Daedalus.

There are three ways to create one:
1. Modify another localization DLL using a resource editor. If you don't
   know the language of the DLL look at Daedalus.exe
2. Modify Daedalus.exe using a resource editor and save the results as a DLL
3. Modify Script1.rc in Daedalus source and build it with rc.exe and link.exe
   (part of Microsoft Platform SDK) or with a third-party .rc compiler


Things to remember
******************

- Set IDS_LOCALIZATION_DLL_FOR_VERSION to the version of Daedalus you are
  localizing (use the value of DAEDALUS_VERSION in Daedalus source)
- If building with link.exe, add "/noentry /subsystem:windows,4.0" to
  link.exe command line
- Set the resource language ids correctly (although they are currently
  unused)
- Give the DLL the proper name (get it from LanguageTable.cpp).
	Examples:
	"Daedalus_fr.dll" for French. It will be used if there isn't a DLL
          for the specific version of french
	"Daedalus_fr-ca.dll" for Canadian French. It will only be used for
          Canadian French
	Note: most of the time only specify the primary language, especially
          if you are building a DLL for the "standard" version of a language
          (e.g. French spoken in France)
- Make sure to put the DLL in the "Localization" folder
- Remember that the DLL will only be used if it's language is set in the
  Control Panel


Troubleshooting
***************

- If you get dialog boxes with white background, add DS_3DLOOK to the dialogs
  or enable "3D Look" if you are using a visual editor
- If column headers are localized but menus aren't, you have set the
  IDS_LOCALIZATION_DLL_FOR_VERSION incorrectly
- If your language isn't listed in LanguageTable.cpp, it means it's not
  supported in Windows 2000. On Windows 2000/XP Daedalus ignores
  LanguageTable.cpp and uses OS functions to determine language names, so
  if your language is supported in an international version of Windows 2000,
  in Windows XP or later, you can use it even if it's not in the table (but
  you must use the correct ISO 639/ISO 3166 language code).
